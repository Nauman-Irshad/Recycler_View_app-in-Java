# Recycler_View_app-in-Java
In Android development, RecyclerView is preferred over ScrollView when displaying lists or multiple items because:

Better Performance ðŸš€

RecyclerView reuses views instead of creating new ones every time.
ScrollView loads all items at once, which can slow down the app if the list is long.
Efficient Memory Usage ðŸ§ 

RecyclerView only loads visible items and reuses off-screen ones.
ScrollView keeps everything in memory, leading to lag and crashes on large lists.
Supports Large Data Sets ðŸ“œ

RecyclerView can handle hundreds or thousands of items smoothly.
ScrollView struggles with large lists and causes performance issues.
More Features ðŸŽ¨

RecyclerView supports grid layouts, horizontal scrolling, animations, and swipe gestures easily.
ScrollView only provides vertical scrolling without optimization.
When to Use ScrollView?
If you have a small amount of content that does not repeat (like a form or a single page).
If you donâ€™t need the optimization that RecyclerView provides.
But since your app has a list with images and stickers, RecyclerView is the best choice for smooth performance and better user experience! ðŸ˜Š
